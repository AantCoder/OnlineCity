	<OCity_AboutGeneralText>Greetings, colonizer!

OnlineCity is an online multiplayer mod for RimWorld. It allows multiple players to play on the same planet online.

After registration, you can create your own colony and play alongside other players. You can monitor the progress of your neighbors, their settlements, and caravans, but most importantly, you will be able to provide each other with materials by transferring food, medicine, weapons, colonists, and more. To do this, just form a caravan like in vanilla RimWorld and send it to them!

The purpose of the mod is to make it possible to play with friends without disturbing the balance or reducing the level of immersion in the game. At the moment the mod is in its early stages. Its functionality includes:

* A game on one planet with the ability to see settlements and caravans of other players

* Exchange of items (including modded items)

* Transferral of settlers and animals between players

* Public and private chat between players

Technical features:

* Any and all combinations of mods are supported, however when sending items to other players both players must have the mod the items are from. There are no restrictions for mod incompatibilities, so be careful

* OnlineCity is completely disabled during a single player game (if you didn’t start with the Multiplayer button at the main menu)

* When registering a new account, the game may freeze for a few minutes. This is normal, please be patient.

* For technical reasons, saving does not work when you exit the game not through the menu. Instead, the game is saved on the server once every 15 minutes

* Currently the mod is focused on co-operative play.

* Developer mode is currently available, but its use is frowned upon (except when it is needed to test the mod).

* Transferring pawns with the HardcoreSK project does not work at the moment

* Goods and pawns can be transferred to offline players

* On the world map, other players' colonies and caravans are coloured blue. You can interact with them by selecting your caravan and right-clicking them.

* You can transfer between settlements and caravans located on the same cell by right-clicking. Be careful of mod incompatibilities and host overload.

* Be careful of how much goods your caravans can carry. They will not be able to move if they are overloaded. You can see how much a caravan can carry by clicking on it.

* Clicking on a player in the chat menu will allow you to send a private message, view their profile, or add them to your current chat channel.

* To choose where items received from other players will be stored, create a stockpile that has 'trad' in the name (e.g. 'Trading', 'Trades', 'Incoming traded items' etc.)

* When transferring pawns to another colony, after the last pawn is traded, all remaining items in the caravan are also added to the trade.

* The game scenario cannot be customized, but the narrator can be changed immediately after starting through the settings

* You cannot play on the same colony as another player. This is unlikely to change.

* Multiplayer saves may be played in singleplayer. Simply load the 'onlineTempCityLoad' save to continue in singleplayer. Note that singleplayer saves cannot be uploaded back to multiplayer.

* The mod does its best not to alter gameplay, it simply adds interactions with other players via existing game mechanics (i.e. caravans). The only major change is saving, as this is done automatically by the server, and the feeling of opening the map and seeing other settlements nearby :)

* An example player interaction might go like this: A raid arrives at your colony. You pause the game and ask a friend for assistance. They send a caravan with some troops to your settlement. Once they arrive, they join your colony and are under your control until the raiding party is pushed back, after which you form them into a caravan and send them back to their original colony. Alternatively, all of the troops except one are sent into your colony so that the caravan is not disbanded. Once their job is complete, you can return them to the caravan and your friend has control of them once again.

* Logs are written to '%AppData%\..\LocalLow\Ludeon Studios\RimWorld by Ludeon Studios\OnlineCity' (this can be copied and pasted into Explorer)

To get a server set up, follow these steps:
1. Unzip server files to a convenient place.
2. Run it. The server creates the folder C:\World. Inside it will be logs and a data file. The server will begin listening on the default port 19019.
3. Register an account. The first player to register becomes an administrator and they are asked for the parameters of the world. After the creation of the world, they are disconnected.
4. Reconnect and resume playing as usual, create a colony, etc.

To recreate the world, close the server console, delete the data file, and start the console again.
